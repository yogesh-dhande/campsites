Portions of that trail also lead southwest to Clackamas Lake Campground and a historic site.\n \nThe Little Crater Lake is only a short hike away. Little Crater Lake is a geologic oddity, possibly formed by artesian water forcing its way through soft, volcanic rock. The beautiful, turquoise water is a wonder to see. The surrounding meadow is a great place for observing birds and other wildlife. The region is ripe for huckleberry picking as well.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers 14 campsites for tent and RV camping. There are four hike-in campsites available as well.

Timothy Lake was created in 1956 as a storage reservoir for the Oak Grove Hydroelectric Project. It is one of the larger lakes in the Mt. Hood National Forest.\n \nThe campground is nestled in a dense mix conifer forest close to the shoreline. Most sites have a thick understory to provide privacy between sites. The wetlands nearby provide an opportunity to observe many species of wildlife.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District is less than 10 miles from the campground. It was built to house Forest Service workers in the early 1900s. The rustic architecture and historic nature of the buildings and the surrounding area draws thousands of tourists each year.<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>A service fee will apply if you change or cancel your reservation.
